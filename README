== HaveFilter matcher

HaveFilter matcher is a custom matcher for rspec suite. It's purpose is a testing of ActionController filters presense.
If you want to test presence of filters today, you have to do something like

@controller.before_filters.should include(:filter_name)

As for me, it just looks ugly. No, really.
I've spent some time thinking about it and made this filter. Sample usage could be found in spec/rails/matchers/have_filter_spec.rb
I'll post some here:

    @controller.should have_filter(:before_filter_method)
    @controller.should have_filter(:before_filter_method).before(:any_action)
    @controller.should have_filter(:after_some_actions_filter).after([:action_1, :action_2])

== Thanks

I would like to say 'thank you' to Yurii Rashkovskii (http://rashkovskii.com) and Michael Klishin (http://novemberain.com). Without them I would never get even a half of Ruby/Rails experience that I have now.
Also, thanks goes to my lovely wife and my family. They keep me turning.
